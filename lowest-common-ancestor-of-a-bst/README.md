# Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree

# Problem

Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
Output: 6
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
```

**Example 2:**

![https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarysearchtree_improved.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarysearchtree_improved.png)

```
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = [2,1], p = 2, q = 1
Output: 2
```

# Approach

The lowest common ancestor is the lowest node in the tree that has both n1 and n2 as descendants, where n1 and n2 are the nodes for which we wish to find the LCA. Hence, the LCA of a binary tree with nodes n1 and n2 is the shared ancestor of n1 and n2 that is located farthest from the root.

To determine the distance between pairs of nodes in a tree, the distance from n1 to n2 can be computed as the distance from the root to n1, plus the distance from the root to n2, minus twice the distance from the root to their lowest common ancestor.

    } else if (p.val > root.val && q.val > root.val) {
        return lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)
    } else {
        return root;
